![Federated MIP Deployment](../README.md) -> `Operating the MIP Federation`

# Operating the MIP Federation
## Using the *tmux* session
*tmux* is a virtual console, which will continue to live on the **pusher**, even if you disconnect your current session. Anytime you may need to operate the federation, you will have to open an SSH session on the **pusher**, and **re**-attach to the *tmux* session. Then, when you're done and you want to disconnect, first detach the *tmux* session, then close your SSH connection.  

### Short *tmux* usage notice
We won't detail the *tmux* usage here, but as a short notice:

* When you're outside (not attached to) a *tmux* session
  * List all the available *tmux* sessions (before you attach a session)
  ```
  tmux ls
  ```
  You will see the different sessions name or id.
  * Attach to a *tmux* session
  ```
  tmux a -t <SESSION_ID>
  ```
* When you're inside (attached to) a *tmux* session
  * Any operation will have to begin with *CTRL + j* (usually *CTRL + b*, but to avoid issues when having *tmux* inside *tmux* inside *tmux*, all the generated MIP-related *tmux* sessions have been redefined with *CTRL + j*)
  * Detach the *tmux* session
  ```
  "CTRL + j" d
  ```
  * Navigate to the *next* window inside the session
  ```
  "CTRL + j" n
  ```
  * Navigate to the *previous* window inside the session
  ```
  "CTRL + j" p
  ```
  * Directly jump to a certain window number (0-9 only)
  ```
  "CTRL + j" <WINDOW_NUMBER>
  ```
  * Navigate to the *next* pane inside a multi-panes window (like the logs window (1))
  ```
  "CTRL + j" o
  ```
  On the MIP-related generated *tmux* session, on any OS **but** Mac (currently), you can also use the *ALT + ARROW_KEYS* shortcut
  * Quickly show the pane numbers
  ```
  "CTRL + j" q
  ```
  * Directly jump to a certain pane number (0-9 only)
  ```
  "CTRL + j" q <PANE_NUMBER> (the number must be entered really quickly after the q)
  ```
  * Zoom (in or out) the currently selected pane
  ```
  "CTRL + j" z
  ```
  * Enter copy mode (to stop the live logs and go back in the pane's history)
  ```
  "CTRL + j" [
  ```
  * Quit copy mode
  ```
  q or ESC
  ```

### Creating the *tmux* session
Now that you know a bit more about *tmux*, we will generate the MIP special *tmux* session (or connect to it, if it already exists).  

On the **pusher** node, with the **mipadmin** user, you have to run
```
mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> tmux
```
This will generate the session if it does not exist, and then, in any case, attach to it.  
If you want to force **re**-generate the *tmux* session, you can use the *--force* flag.

Now that you're inside the session, you will notice that several windows are present (with *<WINDOW_NUMBER>*:*<WINDOW_NAME>* tab names). You can also notice that, left to the tab names, there's the *tmux* session's name (in blue), and it should be the <FEDERATION_NAME>.

|Window Number|Window Name|Description|
| -- | -- | -- |
|0|bash|Console on the **pusher** node|
|1|logs|Multi-panes window to display real-time logs of all the nodes (top-to-bottom, left-to-right: **master**, **ui**, then all the workers)|
|2|deploy|A quick help about the **pusher** commands to operate the main MIP Federation tasks|
|3|<FEDERATION_NAME>-ms|Console on the **master** node|
|4|<FEDERATION_NAME>-ui|Console on the **ui** node|
|5-n|<FEDERATION_NAME>-wk-<HOSPITAL_SHORT_NAME>|Console on the **worker** nodes|

## Consolidating data
In the *tmux* session (opened as **mipadmin** user), in the **pusher** window (#0):
```
mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> data consolidate
```
For each pathology accross the federation **workers**, this will list the different available datasets in the pathology's Common Data Elements (CDE) file, and then, from all the CDEs, it will generate the *pathologies.json* file (and push it to the **ui** node), used by the MIP Web interface to display the different variables.  
In order for you to better understand this process, here's a step-by-step action list

1. For each **worker** node

   1. Connect to the node
   1. Ask it to prepare a list of the available datasets (and for each of those, give a prototype (headers list) of the data)
   1. Download this archived list on the **pusher**
   1. For each pathology in this list, download (on the **pusher**) the corresponding CDE from the **master** node (or directly from the data catalogue, if asked via optional parameters)
1. On the **pusher** node, parse the prepared pathology list
   1. For each pathology, edit the CDE and there, list **only** the available datasets in the federation
   1. Redistribute this modified CDE on the **master** and on each participating **worker** node
   1. With all the available CDE files, "compile" the *pathologies.json* file, and push it on the **ui** node

Alternatively, you can ask to **re**-label the pathologies and/or the datasets by using the flag *--review-dataset-labels*.  
As said earlier, you can ask the script to download the CDEs from the data catalogue using the flag *--online-cdes*.  
If you want to use an non-default data catalogue, you can use the following parameters
* *--datacatalogue-protocol* (*http* | *https*)
* *--datacatalogue-host <DATACATALOGUE_URL>*

Don't hesitate to use *mip --help*.

## Compiling data
In the *tmux* session (opened as **mipadmin** user), in the **pusher** window (#0)
```
mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> data compile
```
At any time, you can **re**-compile by using the *--force* flag.  
You can also specify the pathology(ies) to compile, with the *--pathology \<PATHOLOGIES>* parameter (comma-separated pathologies list).  
If you want to limitate the compilation to a certain node, you can use the *--node \<NODE_NAME>* parameter, but in this case, you'll also have to pass the *--pathology* argument.  

As usual, *mip --help* can give you more details.

## Deploying services
In the *tmux* session (opened as **mipadmin** user), in the **pusher** window (#0)
```
mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> service deploy
```
This will deploy the Docker Swarm network, the master-related containers on the **master** node, and the worker container on each **worker** node.  
At any time, you can **re**-deploy by using the same command.

### Service-related additionnal features
Alternatively, there are different things that you can run in the same way (still on the **pusher** console of the *tmux* session)

* Showing the services status
  ```
  mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> service status
  ```
* Starting the services
  ```
  mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> service start
  ```
* Stopping the services
  ```
  mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> service stop
  ```
* Restarting the services
  ```
  mip --pusher --federation <FEDERATION_NAME> service restart
  ```
  Note that a *restart* is actually different from a *stop*, *start*. See the Docker documentation.

For all these commands (including the *deploy* one), you can use the *--node <NODE_NAME>* parameter to limitate the scope to a certain node.

As usual, *mip --help* can give you more details.
