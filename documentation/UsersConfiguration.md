## Users Configuration
By default MIP has 2 users, one is an administrator and one is a mip user.

First of all, you should change the administrator credentials, from this url: http://{MIP_IP}/auth/realms/master/account/password

The default administrator credentials are the following:
```
username: admin
password: Pa55w0rd
```
