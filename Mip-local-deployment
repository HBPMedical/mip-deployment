MIP Local Deployment Guide
Introduction

The deployment process is divided into different parts along with the different software stacks that need to be deployed. The services that will be deployed are:
    Exareme Local deployment
    Front-end and Backend deployment

This guide will assist you in deploying all the packs together and explain what dependencies each one has with the rest. This guide does not include detailed installation steps for each service but will prompt you to the appropriate guide.
Requirements

Each software stack has it's own requirements but in order to deploy everything into one machine you need at least 16 GB of ram.

All of the software stack is based on docker so you need to install it in the machines that you will use:

    docker (tested using version 17.05.0-ce)
    docker-compose (tested using version 1.17.0)

Each software stack has more specific requirments
